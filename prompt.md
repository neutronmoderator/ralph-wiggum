1. Decide which task to work on next.
   This should be the one YOU decide has the highest priority,
   not necessarily the first in the list.
2. Implement the feature.
3. Check any open feedback loops, such as types and tests.
4. Append your progress to the progress.txt file with:

- Task completed and PRD item reference
- Key decisions made and reasoning
- Files changed
- Keep entries concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

5. Make a git commit of that feature.
6. Update the PRD document and move the feature you just commited to the 'In Review' section of PRD.md.

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE FEATURE.

If all work is complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
