## Loop iteration feature

- Task: Add loop around claude call (hardcoded to 1 iteration)
- Added MAX_ITERATIONS=1 constant for easy future adjustment
- Wrapped claude call in for loop with iteration counter display
- Moved completion check inside loop - exits early on COMPLETE
- Changed end message to indicate max iterations reached if no early exit
- Files changed: ralph-wiggum
